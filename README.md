# Traffic_Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting traffic volume using environmental and temporal features, such as temperature, weather conditions, and time of day. The aim is to build a simple and effective predictive model to assist with traffic management and planning.

## Dataset

The dataset used includes traffic volume data with key features:

- Temperature (K)
- Rainfall and snowfall (mm)
- Cloud cover (%)
- Time-related features (hour, day of the week, month)
- Traffic volume (target variable)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kel-sie/traffic_prediction.git
